Draw Rectangles

Change Color  (S)
-- user can choose *any* other color
-- use .NET color picker UI

Show Current Color (S)
-- the change color button displays the current color

ESC Cancels Draw (M)

Snap-to-Grid (M)
-- 5-pixel grid
-- circles should snap "along the radius" by 5 pixels, rather than the "current mouse position" being snapped to the 5-pixel grid.  No matter where the mouse is dragged, the circle should snap to a radius of 5, 10, 15, etc. pixels

Draw X's (M)
-- same as rectangles, but draw the diagonals rather than the outside lines

Varying Line Widths (M)
-- any UI is fine
-- must support at least 1-7 pixels

Filled Shapes (M)
-- can only fill "solid" shapes (rectangle, circle, oval)
-- fill with the same color as the outline

Draw Ovals (M)
-- draw inside an invisible bounding box (rectangle or X, but drawing the inscribed oval instead)
-- snap bounding box to grid (unlike circles, above)

Fill With Second Color (M)
-- specify a secondary "fill color"
-- use that color when drawing filled shapes
