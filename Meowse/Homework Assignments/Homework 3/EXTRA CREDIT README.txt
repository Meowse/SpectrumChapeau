In your own copy of this Homework 3 folder:
    Create a Visual Studio solution.
    Create a Windows Forms application in this solution.
    Put a TextBox, a Button (“Hello!”), and a Label on the form.
    When the user types their name into the TextBox, and clicks the “Hello!” button, show a MessageBox that says, “Hello, <contents of the TextBox>!”

Google Hints:
    Googling “C# TextBox”, “C# Button”, “C# MessageBox”, etc. should give you examples of how to use these elements.
    Googling “handling a button click in Windows Forms” should give you instructions on how to handle a button click in a Windows Forms application.

Tip:
In order to add an event handler for the “click” event to a button in a Windows Forms application, open up the form designer and then double-click on the button.  This will automatically generate an event handling method for the “click” event and connect it to the button’s “click” event.
