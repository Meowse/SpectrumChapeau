As a user,
I want the window title to be "Action: <the action goes here>" instead of "Does Something <the action goes here",
so that I am not confused about what an "action" is.



As a user,
I want completed actions to say "Done (<the action goes here>)" 
so that I can see what I have completed



As a user,
I want to be able to undo an action
So that I can fix errors in my completion records.



As a user,
I want to only be able to do an un-done action, and un-do a done action,
So that I don't accidentally do or un-do an action twice.



As a user,
I want to be able to do or un-do the most recent action from the main control panel,
so that I don't have to find the action on the screen.



As a user,
I want pressing "Enter" to create a new action,
so that I don't have to use the mouse to create new actions. 
	-- When the Enter key is pressed, the default action should be to click the "Create a New DoesSomething Window" button. 
	-- Google "Setting the AcceptButton on a Form in C#".


As a user,
I want to be required to enter an action description when I create an action,
so that I don't accidentally create blank actions.
	-- note: action description TextBox should no longer default to "Default"
