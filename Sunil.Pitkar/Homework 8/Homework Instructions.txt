Homework 8 is to continue the work we were doing in class in Session 8, implementing UndoRedoActionSource.  Continue writing tests in UndoRedoActionSourceTest, and then writing
code in UndoRedoActionSource to make them pass.  When you have added tests that fully specify
the desired behavior for UndoRedoActionSource, you should be able to replace the use of 
BrokenActionSource<IDrawAction> in DrawIt.cs with a use of UndoRedoActionSource<IDrawAction>, and see
the correct Undo/Redo behavior in the application.

If you are unclear on how to do any of this, it may help to review the last hour or so of Session 8.
