As a user,
I want the window title to be "Action: <the action goes here>" instead of "Does Something <the action goes here",
so that I am not confused about what an "action" is.


As a user,
I want completed actions to say "Done (<the action goes here>)" 
so that I can see what I have completed


As a user,
I want to be able to undo an action
So that I can fix errors in my completion records.



As a user,
I want to only be able to do an un-done action, and un-do a done action,
So that I don't accidentally do or un-do an action twice.



As a user,
I want to be able to do or un-do the most recent action from the main control panel,
so that I don't have to find the action on the screen.
